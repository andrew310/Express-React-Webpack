# Express-React-Webpack
starting point for my future isomorphic projects

You will need two global installs in addition to the npm install command. They are:

npm install webpack -g

npm install babel-cli -g

Then run webpack, and cd into the "server" folder. 

Once inside the server directory, type "babel-node index.js" to launch.
